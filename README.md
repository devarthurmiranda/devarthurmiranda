<br>
  <p>
    In recent years, I have designed and implemented entire ecossystems for companies. I have worked directly or indirectly with Techify, Redes Brasil, TopNet, Pekicode, and Complem. Currently serving on the Techify team, where I develop automation and AI solutions. I previously served as Projects Director at Pekicode, a student-run initiative that helped bridge higher-education talent to the regional job market. I maintain a strong commitment to technical rigor, continuous learning, and delivering measurable results.
