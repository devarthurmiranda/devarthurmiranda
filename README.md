<br>
  <p>
    Specialist in architecting autonomous enterprise ecosystems. I design and deploy end-to-end solutions where AI and automation replace manual operational layers. My portfolio includes contributions to Techify, Redes Brasil, TopNet, and Complem. Currently at Techify, I engineer proprietary AI agents to optimize internal processes. Previously, as Projects Director at Pekicode, I led technical teams and oversaw the delivery of software products for regional clients. My focus is on building self-sustaining, scalable architectures that drive measurable efficiency.
